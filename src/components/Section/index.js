            Iâ€™m from Nashville Tennessee, I went to Tennessee College of Applied Technology in 2013 majoring in
            mechatronics and industrial automation. I started playing around with .net and made a few small apps
            in C# and Visual Basic. I decided I wanted a career in the web development field. I am currently enrolled
            in a full stack web development program at Vanderbilt Coding Bootcamp where we are learning HTML, CSS,
            Javascript, jQuery, API's, Node.js, MongoDB, Express, and React.
